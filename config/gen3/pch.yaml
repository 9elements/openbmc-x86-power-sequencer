# Contains a list of units. Every unit contains logic (similar to a LUT in a
# CPLD).
# Units contain AND gates and OR gates. The order of AND and OR gates is
# controled by 'and_then_or' flag. Every input can be inverted.
# If the inputs need to be stable and logical '1' for a specific amount of time
# specify 'input_stable_usec'. If the input is not stable or logical '0' the
# result is '0'.
# If the first gate is AND and 'invert_first_gate' is set, it acts like a NAND
# gate.
# If the first gate is OR and 'invert_first_gate' is set, it acts like a NOR
# gate.
# Specify 'delay_usec' to delay the output signal by usec.
